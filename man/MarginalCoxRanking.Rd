\title{Marginal Cox ranking function}
\usage{
MarginalCoxRanking(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{input matrix \code{nxp}.}

\item{y}{response variable, \code{y} should be a two-column matrix with columns named time and status. The latter is a binary variable, with 1 indicating event, and 0 indicating right censored.}
}
\value{
A data frame composed by the original indices, gene symbols, the marginal regression coefficients, the regression coefficients and the relative p.values.
