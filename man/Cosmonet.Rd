Cosmonet(
  k,
  x1,
  y1,
  x2,
  y2,
  screenVars,
  family = "Cox",
  penalty = "Net",
  Omega = NULL,
  alpha = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{times to loop through cross validation.}

\item{x1}{input training matrix \eqn{n1xp}.}

\item{y1}{response variable, \code{y1} should be a two-column matrix with columns named time and status. The latter is a binary variable, with 1 indicating event, and 0 indicating right censored.}

\item{x2}{input testing matrix \eqn{n2xp}. Each row represents an observation, while each column a variable.}

\item{y2}{response variable, \code{y2} should be a two-column data frame with columns named time and status. The latter is a binary variable, with 1 indicating event, and 0 indicating right censored. The rownames indicate the sample names ordered as the samples in the input testing matrix.}

\item{screenVars}{screened variables obtained from BMD- or DAD-, or BMD+DAD-screening.}

\item{family}{Cox proportional hazards regression model.}

\item{penalty}{penalty type. Can choose "Net" where \code{Omega} matrix is requested.
For penalty = "Net", the penalty is defined as
\eqn{\lambda*{\alpha*||\beta||_1+(1-\lapha)/2*(\beta^{T}L\beta)}},
where \eqn{L} is a Laplacian matrix calculated from \code{Omega}.}

\item{Omega}{adjacency matrix with zero diagonal and non-negative off-diagonal used to calculate Laplacian matrix.}

\item{alpha}{ratio between \code{L1} and Laplacian for \code{Net}. Default is \code{alpha = 0.5}.}

\description{
This function performs two main step: (i) penalized Cox regression methods to select a subset of potential biomarkers by using the training set \eqn{T}; (ii) the validation test by using the testing set \eqn{D}.
}
\details{
The first step is the variable screening of the data which aimed to reduce the number of variables for a
large to a moderate scale. To this purpose, we assume that only a small number of these \eqn{p} variables is affecting
the survival outcome. Therefore, we filter out variables that are considered not relevant for the disease under
investigation. To this purpose, we consider three different types of variable screenings: biomedical
screening (BMD-screening), data-driven screening (DAD-screening) and the fusion of biomedical and
data-driven screening (BMD+DAD-screening). The second step is the application of penalized methods using
the subset of screened variables \eqn{\{x_j,j \in \mathcal{I}\}} (where \eqn{\mathcal{I}} depends on the type screening performed)
as new feature space to further remove not significant variables from the model. To assess the stability of
the survival prediction we performed the five-fold cross-validation different times and we take as estimate
the average value of \eqn{\lambda} and the corrisponding \eqn{\alpha}. These two parameters are used to fit
the corresponding penalized Cox model and obtain the parameter estimate of \eqn{\beta_\mathcal{I}}.
Survival analysis is performed using the Kaplan Meier curves after dividing the patients in
two risk groups (high-and-low risk group) on the basis of the prognostic index \eqn{PI} computed with the gene signature.
The \eqn{p-value}, used to test the null hypothesis that the survival curves are identical vs. the alternative that
the two groups have different survival, is calculated by using the \eqn{log-rank test}.
